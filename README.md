# Piano-tiles-bot

Python script that plays piano tiles for you

Bot for any kind of game that you need to identify color changes in a grid, you can use this in piano tiles for example or similars as you can choose the amount of tiles that need to be observed and the color we are waiting for in that position

Wanted to make it faster with multithreading but i didn't quite nail that so don't use it with 
too many tiles!

# Usage

Hold K to snipe or J to reverse snipe! - Press P to stop the bot

"Reverse snipe" is to look for any color that's not the one you chose
