# Piano-tiles-bot
Python script that plays piano tiles for you

Bot for any kind of game that you need to identify color changes in a grid, you can use this in piano tiles for example or similars as you can choose the amount of tiles that we need to check and the color we are waiting for in that position


Wanted to make it faster with multithreading but i didn't quite nail that so don't use it yet

# USAGE

Hold K to snipe or J to reverse snipe! - Press P to stop the bot

"Reverse snipe" is to look for any color that's not the one you chose
